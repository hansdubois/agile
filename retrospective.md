# Retrospective
In the beginning of a team it is good to start a retrospective with plusses and minuses.
  This way you can easily find difficulties that hapend during the previous sprint.

## Preparation
Two days in advance of the retrospective I remind everyone that we have a retrospective coming up and how they should prepare for it.

## Setting the stage
To kick of the retrospective I tell everyone why they are here:
  "We are here to find any difficulties that happend during the sprint and see how we can improve on that"
I also tell them what the time schedule is for the meeting, this way can keep discussions effective.  

First I ask to all the team members whether there is something they would like to add to this meeting. If so I will ask what it is and add it to the meeting schedule.

After that I tell everyone what is done during the sprint:
  "We did a, b, c, etc. Which resulted in: d, e, f"

## Gathering data / Generate insights
Everyone brings their plusses and minuses to the table, I do not group the cards unless the team members to it them selfs, this is because I want everybody to be able to explain why the card is there and what we can learn from it.

Start of with plusses they take less time and do not contribute as much as the minuses to the goals. With every point that is on the table I ask the person who put it there to explain it. If it's a long explanation i'll summarize it and ask they person if that is what he meant if so, I ask they others if they agree and what we can learn from it and write that down.

After that I will bring up the remember sheet of last retrospective and ask the team "Last retrospective we promised to work on these topics, what did we achieve and how did we do that?".

## Decide what to do
After all the cards have been explained I give a summary of what I have written down, and ask the Team "What are the two most important things we need to work on". If the team is divided I ask them to vote. If there is room for three topics we will choose three.

## Close the retrospective
It's important to close the retrospective by repeating what we have done in the meeting and what the top learning points are for the coming two weeks. And thank everyone for attending this meeting.
